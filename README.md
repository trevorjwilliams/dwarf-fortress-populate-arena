# dwarf-fortress-populate-arena
Simple autohotkey script for setting up a grid of arenas in order to attempt to gather a statistically-significant sampling of the likely outcome of a given fight.

Depends on having an appropriate macro (`.mak` files under `data/init/macros`) for creating the fighters in question.  Included is an example file for the formidable `Taardvark.mak`.

Also depends on having the included `arena.txt` under `data/init`.
